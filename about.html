        <h1 class="text-center m-3">Evolution of Tikau Emirate</h1>
        <p>At its initial emergence, Tikau Dynasty used to pay allegiance to Kanem-Borno Empire. According to a manuscript on pre-conial history of Tikau, there were two clashes between Borno and Kebbi during the reign of Mai Ali Gaji, during which the Tikau
            people gave their support to Mai Ali gaji , which led to his victory over Kebbi.<br></p>
        <p>However, following internal split, the three brothers left Shikau and moved down south until they came to here they founded Tikau and Nanai settlements in the north and south of Potiskum, respectively. Hence, the descendants of these people spread
            and settled on the Yobe/Bauchi plains. Currently, the Tikau clan is regarded as the primus inter pares among the Karai-Karai clans and is the the rally point of the generality of Karai-Karai people.<br></p>
        <p>After the reign of Shikau, legend showed that Ndiirama Jiiji, who reigned between 1750 and 1758 took over the mantle of leadership and was said to have completed the building of Tikau fortification walls. A chain of other successive rules thereafter
            followed. By 1799 Ndiirama Matata was on the throne, but following series of border skirmishes, Matata was killed in one of such battles by Kanem-Borno warriors in 1843 and was succeeded by Mai Warkati. It is important to state that Mai warkati
            was the first Tikau ruler to adopt the Kanuri title of “Mai”. He died in 1862 and was succeeded by Mai Usaku who ruled from 1862-1887.<br></p>
        <p>Mai Usaku was succeeded by the famous Tikau ruler, Mai Saaban, who reigned from 1887 to 1921. It was during his reign that Tikau Dynasty attained its greatness and experienced mass territorial expansion which was only halted by the arrival of
            the British colonials forces at the dawn of the 20th Century. Likewise, it was also during his era that the British colonists conquered the area but despite their military prowess, Mai Saaban was reported to have resisted the subjugation of
            his authority to ruler-ship. Mai Saaban’s era is regarded as the turning point in the history of Tikau Emirate.<br></p>
        <p>After the death of Mai Saaban, he was succeeded briefly by his brother Mai Gaski Usaku who reigned for four years. In 1924 Main Saaban’s son, Grema ascended to the throne and ruled from 1924-1945. It was during Mai Gremas’s reign that the British
            colonists finally relocated Fika Emirate’s administrative headquarters from Fika to Potiskum town, and included Tikau in the new Fika Emirate. This imposition consequently caused a lot of setback on the development and growth of Tikau Dynasty.
            It was the period that the area was relegated to the status of a village losings its sovereignty and independence. Consequently, Mai Grema became the first Village Head of Tikau Area with headquarters at Tikau. As a visionary leader, however,
            he was able to mobilize his people to accommodate and endure the retrogressive developments in the status of their colonized domain.<br></p>
        <p>Mai Grema died in 1945 and he was succeeded by his son, Mai Abubakar Ibn Grema, the first Tikau ruler to receive Western Education. He served as a teacher and counselor under the defunct Fika Native Authority from 1945-1962. Mai Abubakar was appointed
            the District Head of Nangere (comprising the present day Tikau and Pataskum Emirates) in 1962 and he held to that position until 1993 when he was appointed Emir of Tikau. He died in 2001 and was succeeded by his son, Alhaji (Dr.) Muhammadu
            Abubakar ibn Grema in 2001, to date.<br></p>
